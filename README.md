## ⚡ Overview

When disasters strike, milliseconds matter. **CrisisLink** is a modern, high-performance command center dashboard built to solve the logistical nightmares of global crisis response. By leveraging an interactive mapping system, real-time intelligence feeds, and an integrated Logistics AI, CrisisLink empowers field commanders to make split-second, data-driven decisions that save lives.

## ✨ Features

- **Global Command Grid:** An interactive, CSS Grid-based map projection with dynamic scanning effects, visualizing active dispatch routes and critical threat nodes across all sectors.
- **Live Intel Feed:** A real-time, scrolling multimodality dashboard that ingests critical alerts, warnings, and dispatch logs with automated mitigation strategies.
- **Logistics AI Chat:** Powered by the Vercel AI SDK, our system analyzes incoming distress text scenarios (e.g., *"We need 500 blankets in Sector 3"*) and outputs optimal logistical routing, inventory checks, and deployment strategies.
- **Series-A Aesthetic:** Built with a breathtaking, immersive dark-mode UI utilizing Tailwind CSS, refined gradients, glassmorphism, and smooth micro-animations.
